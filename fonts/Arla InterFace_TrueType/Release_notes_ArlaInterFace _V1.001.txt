1 File formats: The files have been delivered in the TrueType-based OpenType format, for use in all major Operating Systems, and also in Embedded OpenType format and Web Open Font Format for all major browsers.
2 Embedding settings: Everything is allowed (installable mode).
3 Hinting information: Fonts have been hinted in the Y direction only, suitable for ClearType rasterization modes.

  eg:

  @font-face {
	  font-family: Arla InterFace W;
	  src: url(css/type/ArlaIF_W_Rg.eot?#iefix;) format("embedded-opentype");
	  }
  body { font-family: Arla InterFace W, Georgia; }
